# tensorflow_files_for_github
All the files you need for the Home-Assistant [tensorflow component](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/image_processing.tensorflow/).

Just `cd` into your configuration directory then `git clone` this repo.

FYI utils has the function that maps the integers returned by the model to the actual category, data has the actual mappings, and proto is how tensorflow object detection tensor gets the data.
